# DuplicateChecker
The program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

The intended function of this program is to check for traces that have the EXACT same name and trace.
This program checks each section individually, and the user has the option to delete duplicate traces.

To use this program, run the Python file.
You will need to provide directory paths for both the series and an empty folder to contain the new series files.
To get these, you can access the folders in your file explorer and copy the "link" at the top.
