# DuplicateChecker
The program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

The intended function of this program is to check for traces that have the EXACT same name and trace.
This program checks each section individually, and the user has the option to delete duplicate traces.

To use this program, run the Python file.
You will be prompted for the name of the series -- this program assumes that the files will all be named after the series name.
You will need to provide directory paths for both the series and an empty folder to contain the new series files.
To get these, you can access the folders in your file explorer and copy the "link" at the top.
You will also need to know the number of sections -- for example, if the series goes from sections 0-275, there are 276 sections.
